# Feedback and Support

We value the cooperation and collaboration to enhance features and functions of the platform. Therefore, we would like to encourage you to talk with us in case you would like to implement new features or in case you have ideas how to improve the platform. Your feedback would be definitely discussed, and you will receive response on what is our standpoint.

For any kind of feedback, use the [Support Email](mailto:support@czertainly.com) or use the [Support Portal](https://czertainly.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/1).

You can also follow us on [GitHub](https://github.com/3KeyCompany/CZERTAINLY), where you can open discussions about the platform and the development, or any related topics.
