# Application Logs

Application logs are generated to record the events that are affecting the platform. The application logs are used for monitoring and troubleshooting the platform.
In general, the application logs are generated by the core components of the CZERTAINLY platform and are typically sent to the standard output (stdout) or standard error (stderr) streams of containers and can be collected by the logging infrastructure.

Application logs are useful as additional information that can help to understand the context of the events that are happening in the platform. The application logs can be used to identify the root cause of the issues and to troubleshoot the problems.

## Structure of the application log

The application logs are non-structured logs, which means that the logs are not following any specific structure. The logs are typically in the form of plain text.

## Example of the application log

The following is an example of the application log:
