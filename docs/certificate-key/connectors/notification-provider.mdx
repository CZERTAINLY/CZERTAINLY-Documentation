# Notification Provider

:::info[Using Notification Provider]
Notification Provider provides interface to extend the notification features of the platform. Notification Provider can be used to send notifications to the users of the platform using email, SMS, Slack, Team, webhook, or any other technology. 
:::

## Overview

Notification Provider handles notifications that should be sent to the users outside the scope of the deployment of the platform (external notification). The Notification Provider can be used to send notifications to the users of the platform using various technologies. Typical use cases are sending notifications to the users using email, however, the Notification Provider can be also used to create tickets in the ticketing system.

## How it works

Notification Provider consumes notification data from the `Core` and sends the notifications to the recipient(s) using the configured technology.

## Provider objects

[`Notification`](../concept-design/core-components/notification.md) objects are managed in the platform through the Notification Provider implementation.
Each `Notification` represents a single notification processing definition.

## Processes related to `Notification`

The following processes are associated with the Notification Provider and management of the `Notification` objects.

### Create `Notification` instance

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl %API_BASE_URL
        Client -> Core [[core-notification/#tag/External-Notification-Management/operation/createNotificationInstance]]: Add Notification
        Core->Core: Check existence of Connector and Notification
        Core -> Connector : Validate Attributes
        Connector --> Core: Result of Attribute validation
        Core -> Connector [[connector-notification-provider/#tag/Notification-instances-Management/operation/createNotificationInstance]]: Create Notification
        Connector -> Connector: Validation of request
        note right of Connector: Attributes are validated against the implementation requirements
        Connector --> Core: Return Notification response
        Core -> Core : Store Notification reference
        Core --> Client: Return Notification UUID
    @enduml
```

### Get `Notification` instance details

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl %API_BASE_URL
        Client -> Core [[core-notification/#tag/External-Notification-Management/operation/getNotificationInstance]]: Get details of Notification
        Core -> Connector [[connector-notification-provider/#tag/Notification-instances-Management/operation/getNotificationInstance]]: Get Notification
        note right of Core: Details of the Notification is processed and combined with Notification reference from core
        Connector --> Core: Return Notification details
        Core -> Client: Return Notification details
    @enduml
```

### Update `Notification` instance

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl %API_BASE_URL
        Client -> Core [[core-notification/#tag/External-Notification-Management/operation/editNotificationInstance]]: Update Notification
        Core -> Connector : Validate Attributes
        Connector --> Core: Result of Attributes validation
        Core -> Connector [[connector-notification-provider/#tag/Notification-instances-Management/operation/updateNotificationInstance]]: Update Notification
        Connector -> Connector: Validation of request and update
        note right of Connector: Attributes are validated against the implementation requirements
        Connector --> Core: Return Notification response
        Core -> Core : Update Notification reference in the database
        Core --> Client: Return Notification object
    @enduml
```

### Delete `Notification` instance

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl %API_BASE_URL
        Client -> Core [[core-notification/#tag/External-Notification-Management/operation/deleteNotificationInstance]]: Remove Notification
        Core -> Core : Check dependencies
        Core -> Connector [[connector-notification-provider/#tag/Notification-instances-Management/operation/removeNotificationInstance]]: Remove Notification
        Connector --> Core: Return Notification deletion response
        Core -> Core : Delete Notification reference
        Core --> Client: Return deletion status
    @enduml
```

## Sending notifications

Once the notification should be sent to the recipient(s), the `Notification` object is used as proxy to the Notification Provider. The `Notification` object contains the information about how the notification should be processed. The `Notification` with the provided notification data.

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl %API_BASE_URL
        Core -> Core: Notification service
        Core -> Connector [[connector-notification-provider/#tag/Notification-instances-Management/operation/sendNotification]]: Send notification request
        Connector -> Connector: Process notification
        Connector --> Core: Return notification processing result
        Core -> Core : Process response internally
    @enduml
```

## Specification and example

The Notification Provider implements [Common Interfaces](common-interfaces/overview.md) and the following additional interfaces:
- [Notification Instances Management](/api/connector-notification-provider/#tag/Notification-instances-Management)

The OpenAPI specification of the Notification Provider can be found here: [Connector API - Notification Provider](/api/connector-notification-provider/).
