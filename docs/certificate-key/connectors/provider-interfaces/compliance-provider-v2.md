# Compliance Provider v2

## Overview

Various cryptographic assets, like certificate and cryptographic key, can contain various attributes and can be based on different algorithms.
There are also various standards and regulations that require specific behavior of the certificate, for example to be able to react on algorithm deprecation or vulnerabilities.
The compliance checking helps to monitor the compliance status of each certificate (and other supported compliance subjects) that is included in the inventory of the platform.

Compliance Provider v2 implements the functionality of compliance settings and checking for different objects available in the platform.
It applies specific compliance rules and group of compliance rules to objects and informs about the compliance status. Based on the compliance check, the object will either be determined as compliant or not compliant.

Currently supported resources that can be checked for compliance are:
- Certificates
- Certificate Requests
- Cryptographic Keys and its items

## How it works

Compliance Provider v2 have a set of applicable compliance rules and groups that can be configured as part of the `Compliance Profile`.
Each rule needs to specify resource for which is applicable (e.g. Certificate) and optionally type of resource object (e.g. Certificate type `X.509`). This defines the set of compliance requirements.

To check for the compliance status, `Compliance Profile` should be associated with corresponding profile (e.g. `RA Profile` for resource Certificate).
After that every `Certificate` managed by such `RA Profile` will be checked against compliance rules for Certificates configured in the `Compliance Profile`.
Compliance checking can be executed on `RA Profile` level (for all `Certificates`), for every specific `Certificate` in the inventory, or for each `Compliance Profile`. 

## Provider objects

[`Compliance Profiles`](../../concept-design/core-components/compliance-profile.md) objects are managed in the platform through the Compliance Provider implementation.
Each `Compliance Profile` contains a list of available compliance rules and groups that can be applied for a compliance checking.
Many different `Compliance Profiles` with different compliance requirements can be managed and applied on individual resource objects.

## Processes

The following processes are associated with the Compliance Provider and management of the `Compliance Profile` objects and checking compliance status of object.

### Retrieve Compliance Groups and its detail

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-compliance-v2/#tag/Compliance-Profile-Management-v2/operation/getComplianceGroupsV2]]: Get Compliance Groups from provider
        Core -> Core: Determine API version of selected compliance provider
        Core -> Connector [[connector-compliance-provider-v2/#tag/Compliance-Rules/operation/getGroups]]: Request to retrieve groups from provider
        Connector --> Core: List Compliance Groups
        Core -> Core: Set availability status of each provider rule and group 
        Core -> Client: Return Compliance Groups of specified Compliance Provider
        Client -> Core [[core-compliance-v2/#tag/Compliance-Profile-Management-v2/operation/getComplianceGroupRulesV2]]: Get Compliance Group rules
        Core -> Connector [[connector-compliance-provider-v2/#tag/Compliance-Rules/operation/getGroupRules]]: Request to retrieve group rules from provider
        Connector --> Core: List Compliance Rules belonging to the group
        Core -> Client: Return Compliance Group rules
    @enduml
```

### Retrieve Compliance Rules and Groups in batch

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-compliance-v2/#tag/Compliance-Profile-Management-v2/operation/getComplianceProfileV2]]: Get detail of Compliance Profile
        Core -> Core: Retrieve Compliance Profile and its associated rules and groups
        Core -> Connector [[connector-compliance-provider-v2/#tag/Compliance-Rules/operation/getRulesBatch]]: Construct batch request to retrieve rules and groups from provider
        Connector --> Connector: Load all rules and groups
        Connector --> Core: List Compliance Rules and groups
        Core -> Core: Set availability status of each provider rule and group 
        Core -> Client: Return Compliance Profile detail
    @enduml
```

### Check Compliance of object

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-compliance-v2/#tag/Compliance-Management-v2/operation/checkResourceObjectComplianceV2]]: Initiate Compliance Check
        Core --> Client: Return Async response
        Core -> Core: Get Compliance Profile of the object
        Core -> Core: Get applicable compliance rules and groups of the Compliance profile
        loop for each Compliance Provider
            Core -> Connector [[connector-compliance-provider-v2/#tag/Compliance-Rules/operation/getRulesBatch]]: Retrieve rules and groups from provider
            Connector --> Core: Return rules and groups
            Core --> Core: Update compliance result for not available or updated rules
            Core -> Connector [[connector-compliance-provider-v2/#tag/Compliance/operation/checkCompliance]]: Check object compliance for remaining rules
            Connector --> Connector: Evaluate each rule
            Connector --> Core: Return Compliance Check Result
        end
        Core -> Core: Aggregate Compliance Result
        Core -> Core: Store Compliance Result
    @enduml
```

:::info
When a request is made to check the compliance of the `Certificate`, the `Core` gathers list of rules configured in the associated `Compliance Profile` with resource Certificate and request each Compliance Profiles for the specific compliance rule result.
After all compliance rules are evaluated, the `Core` then computes the overall compliance status.

## Specification and example

The Compliance Provider implements [Common Interfaces](../common-interfaces/overview.md) and the following additional interfaces:
- [Compliance Rules](/api/connector-compliance-provider-v2/#tag/Compliance-Rules)
- [Compliance](/api/connector-compliance-provider-v2/#tag/Compliance)

The OpenAPI specification of the Compliance Provider can be found here: [Connector API - Compliance Provider v2](/api/connector-compliance-provider-v2/).
