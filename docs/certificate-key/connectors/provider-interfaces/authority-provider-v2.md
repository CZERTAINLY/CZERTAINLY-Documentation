# Authority Provider v2

## Overview

Authority Provider v2 interface is used to manage operations with certificates issued by certification authority. The Authority Provider v2 acts as an interface between the `Core` and the certification authority providing the following management functions:
1. Issue
2. Renew
3. Revoke
4. Cancel a parked issue or revoke (asynchronous flows)
5. Poll the status of a parked issue or revoke (asynchronous flows)

## How it works

Authority Provider v2 provides the ability to communicate with different types and technologies of certification authorities. The platform supports both **synchronous** authorities (the connector returns the issued or revoked certificate immediately) and **asynchronous** authorities (the connector parks the operation and reports back later, or hands the operation off to an operator). The signal between Core and the connector for the asynchronous case is the HTTP response code on the existing `issueCertificate` / `renewCertificate` / `revokeCertificate` calls — see [Asynchronous certificate operations](#asynchronous-certificate-operations) below.

## Provider objects

[`Authority`](../../concept-design/core-components/authority.md) objects are managed in the platform through the Authority Provider v2 implementation.

## Processes

The following processes are associated with the Authority Provider v2 and management of the `Authority` objects.

## `Authority` Instance Management

### Create `Authority` Instance

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-authority/#tag/Authority-Management/operation/createAuthorityInstance]]: Add Authority Instance
        Core->Core: Check existence of Connector and Authority
        Core -> Connector : Validate Attributes
        Connector --> Core: Result of Attribute validation
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Authority-Management/operation/createAuthorityInstance]]: Create Authority instance
        Connector -> Connector: Validation of connection to CA
        note right of Connector: Connection to the CA with the attributes is validated
        Connector --> Core: Return Authority Instance response
        Core -> Core : Store Authority Instance Reference
        Core --> Client: Return Authority UUID
    @enduml
```

### Get `Authority` Instance Details

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-authority/#tag/Authority-Management/operation/getAuthorityInstance]]: Details of an Authority instance
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Authority-Management/operation/getAuthorityInstance]]: Get an Authority instance
        note right of Core: Details of the Authority instance is processed and combined with Authority Instance Reference from core
        Connector --> Core: Return Authority details
        Core -> Client: Return Authority details
    @enduml
```

### Update `Authority` Instance

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber

### Delete `Authority` Instance

The below diagram shows the sequence of messages that are exchanged between the client, core, and provider to delete an Authority instance.

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-authority/#tag/Authority-Management/operation/deleteAuthorityInstance]]: Remove Authority instance
        Core -> Core : Check dependencies
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Authority-Management/operation/removeAuthorityInstance]]: Remove Authority instance
        Connector --> Core: Return Authority Instance deletion response
        Core -> Core : Delete Authority Instance Reference
        Core --> Client: Return deletion status
    @enduml
```

## `Certificate` Management

    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-client-operations/#tag/v2-Client-Operations/operation/revokeCertificate]]: Revoke Certificate
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Certificate-Management/operation/validateRevokeCertificateAttributes]]: Validate Attributes
        Connector --> Core: Result of Attribute validation
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Certificate-Management/operation/revokeCertificate]]: Revoke Certificate
        Connector -> CA: Revoke Certificate
        CA --> Connector: Return Certificate revocation status
        Connector --> Core: Return Certificate revocation response
        Core -> Core : Set Certificate status as revoked
        Core --> Client: Return revocation status
    @enduml
```

## Asynchronous certificate operations

When a certificate authority cannot complete `issue`, `renew`, or `revoke` synchronously — for example a manual or air-gapped CA, a CA that processes requests in batches, or an external authority that requires an operator-driven step — the connector **parks** the operation. The platform handles the parked state, finalisation, and cancellation through the existing v2 endpoints plus four purely-additive endpoints.

### Parking signal

The signal is the HTTP response on the existing `issueCertificate` / `renewCertificate` / `revokeCertificate` calls:

| Connector response                               | Cert state transition                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200 OK` + `certificateData` (+ optional `meta`) | → `Issued` (issue/renew) or `Revoked` (revoke).                       | Today's synchronous behaviour. Unchanged.                                                                            |
| `202 Accepted` (+ optional `meta`)               | → `Pending Issue` (issue/renew) or `Pending Revoke` (revoke). Parked. | New. Existing connectors continue to return `200`; sync paths are unaffected.                                        |
| Any other status / connector exception           | → `Failed` (or back to `Issued` for revoke). Unchanged.               |                                                                                                                      |

The `meta` returned with `202` is **opaque** to Core. The connector chooses what to put in it (order ID, transaction reference, multi-field state) and Core stores it against the certificate via the same persistence path used for `200 OK + meta` today. Core does not interpret the value.

There is **no platform-level "offline" or "external" classification** of authorities, RA profiles, or connectors. Behaviour is driven by certificate state and the connector's response.

### Parked-operation lifecycle endpoints

Four purely-additive endpoints complete the parked-operation lifecycle:

| Method                       | HTTP   | Path                                                                                  | Body                                                                                  | Response                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cancelIssueCertificate`     | `POST` | `/v2/authorityProvider/authorities/{uuid}/certificates/issue/cancel`                  | `CertificateOperationCancelRequestDto { raProfileAttributes, meta }`                  | `204 No Content` (acknowledged); `404` (not tracked); `422` (refuses to abort, with reason)               |
| `cancelRevokeCertificate`    | `POST` | `/v2/authorityProvider/authorities/{uuid}/certificates/revoke/cancel`                 | `CertificateOperationCancelRequestDto { raProfileAttributes, meta }`                  | `204 No Content` (acknowledged); `404` (not tracked); `422` (refuses to abort, with reason)               |
| `getIssueCertificateStatus`  | `POST` | `/v2/authorityProvider/authorities/{uuid}/certificates/issue/status`                  | `CertificateOperationStatusRequestDto { raProfileAttributes, meta }`                  | `CertificateOperationStatusResponseDto { status: IN_PROGRESS \| COMPLETED \| FAILED, certificateData?, meta?, reason? }` |
| `getRevokeCertificateStatus` | `POST` | `/v2/authorityProvider/authorities/{uuid}/certificates/revoke/status`                 | `CertificateOperationStatusRequestDto { raProfileAttributes, meta }`                  | `CertificateOperationStatusResponseDto { status: IN_PROGRESS \| COMPLETED \| FAILED, meta?, reason? }`     |

The operation type is explicit in the path so the connector's two cancel handlers (and two status handlers) know unambiguously what they're acting on. Core dispatches based on certificate state — `Pending Issue` certificates route to the `issue/*` endpoints; `Pending Revoke` certificates route to the `revoke/*` endpoints.

**Cancel response semantics.** Core treats the connector's response as follows:
- `204 No Content` — cancel acknowledged. Core proceeds with the local state transition.
- `404 Not Found` — connector does not track the operation (already finalised externally, or implementation is stateless). **Soft failure**: Core records the result in event history and proceeds with the local transition.
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` (with reason) — connector refuses to abort (e.g., the underlying CA cannot abort the operation). **Hard failure**: Core surfaces the reason to the user and leaves the certificate in its pending state.
- `5xx` / network error — soft failure. Core records the error and proceeds with the local transition (cancel is user intent).

**Status response semantics.** When `status = COMPLETED` for an issue/renew, `certificateData` carries the Base64 cert content and Core finalises through the same internal path used by manual upload. When `status = COMPLETED` for revoke, no payload is needed — Core finalises the revoke transition. When `status = FAILED`, the connector's `reason` is surfaced and the certificate moves to `Failed`. The optional `meta` in the response lets the connector refresh the tracked state on each poll.

Sync-only connectors are never asked: Core only invokes these four endpoints against certificates in `Pending Issue` / `Pending Revoke`, which only exist after a `202` response. Existing sync connectors are unaffected and need no changes. A connector that does not track operation state may return `404 Not Found` from a status endpoint; Core treats this as "this connector does not support polling for this operation".

### Park `Certificate` Issue (Renew)

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-client-operations/#tag/v2-Client-Operations/operation/issueCertificate]]: Issue Certificate
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Certificate-Management/operation/issueCertificate]]: Issue Certificate
        Connector -> CA: Submit issue request
        CA --> Connector: Operation accepted (no certificate yet)
        Connector --> Core: 202 Accepted (+ optional meta)
        Core -> Core : Store meta
        Core -> Core : Set Certificate state to Pending Issue
        Core --> Client: Return Certificate UUID
    @enduml
```

The same flow applies to `renewCertificate` — the new certificate ends in `Pending Issue` while the predecessor remains `Issued` until the new certificate is finalised.

### Park `Certificate` Revoke

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-client-operations/#tag/v2-Client-Operations/operation/revokeCertificate]]: Revoke Certificate
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Certificate-Management/operation/revokeCertificate]]: Revoke Certificate
        Connector -> CA: Submit revoke request
        CA --> Connector: Operation accepted (not yet revoked)
        Connector --> Core: 202 Accepted (+ optional meta)
        Core -> Core : Store meta + preserve destroyKey flag and revoke attributes
        Core -> Core : Set Certificate state to Pending Revoke
        Core --> Client: Return revocation status
    @enduml
```

The `destroyKey` flag and revoke attributes from the original request are preserved on the certificate and applied when the parked revoke is confirmed.

### Finalise parked Issue (manual upload)

When an operator uploads the externally-issued certificate, Core verifies the upload, asks the connector to identify it, and transitions the certificate to `Issued`.

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-client-operations/#tag/v2-Client-Operations/operation/manuallyIssueCertificate]]: Manual Finalise Issue
        Core -> Core : Validate upload (public key match)
        Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Certificate-Management/operation/identifyCertificate]]: Identify Certificate
        Connector --> Core : Identification result
        Core -> Core : Store Certificate, apply custom attributes
        Core -> Core : Set Certificate state to Issued
        Core --> Client : Return Certificate detail
    @enduml
```

### Confirm parked Revoke

Used when the revocation has been completed externally and the operator confirms it in the platform.

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-client-operations/#tag/v2-Client-Operations/operation/manuallyConfirmRevoke]]: Manual Confirm Revoke
        Core -> Core : Apply preserved revoke attributes
        Core -> Core : Destroy key if requested
        Core -> Core : Set Certificate state to Revoked
        Core --> Client : Return confirmation
    @enduml
```

### Cancel parked operation

Used when the parked operation is no longer wanted. Core dispatches to the appropriate connector cancel endpoint based on certificate state.

```plantuml
    @startuml
    autonumber
    skinparam topurl https://docs.otilm.com/api/
        Client -> Core [[core-client-operations/#tag/v2-Client-Operations/operation/cancelPendingCertificateOperation]]: Cancel Pending Operation
        alt state is Pending Issue
            Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Certificate-Management/operation/cancelIssueCertificate]]: Cancel Issue
        else state is Pending Revoke
            Core -> Connector [[connector-authority-provider-v2/#tag/Certificate-Management/operation/cancelRevokeCertificate]]: Cancel Revoke
        end
        Connector --> Core : Cancel response
        alt Connector refused (422)
            Core --> Client : Validation error (state unchanged)
        else Connector accepted, not tracked, or transient failure
            Core -> Core : Apply local transition (Failed / Issued)
            Core --> Client : Return cancellation status
        end
    @enduml
```

### Operations blocked while pending

While a certificate is in `Pending Issue` or `Pending Revoke`, the following client operations return `400 Bad Request`:

- `renewCertificate`
- `rekeyCertificate`
- `revokeCertificate` (for certificates in `Pending Issue`)
- Re-issue of the same `Requested` certificate
- Switch RA profile

The escape hatch from a stuck pending state is **Cancel parked operation**.
