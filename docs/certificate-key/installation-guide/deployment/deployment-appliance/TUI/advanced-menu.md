## Remove CZERTAINLY

Removing CZERTAINLY from appliance mainly means deleting `czertainly` namespace from Kubernetes. Purpose of this tasks is preparation step for CZERTAINLY re-installation.

This task preserves anything that was configured, including CZERTAINLY data which is stored in Postgres database.

## Install only CZERTAINLY

This tasks only re/install CZERTAINLY software. It is complementary to previous task and reduce reinstallation time comparing to full installation when status of RKE2 is verified. But you have to have operational RKE2 to sucesffuly finish this task.

## Remove RKE2 & CZERTAINLY

Removing RKE2 (Kubernetes) and CZERTAINLY might be useful when you change hostname or IP address of virtual appliance. This is preparation step for even deeper CZERTAINLY re-installation.

This task preserves anything that was configured, including CZERTAINLY data which is stored in Postgres database.

## Enter system shell

You can enter system shell as `czertainly` user. The user is in `sudo` group. You can do any administrative task you wish. Please be very careful.

:::warning[System shell access]
If you are not sure about the result of your operations on the system shell, consult it with the CZERTAINLY support team. It may happen that you will break the system and you will not be able to access it anymore.
