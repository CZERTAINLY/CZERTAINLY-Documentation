# Notifications

The `Notifications` feature empowers administrators to seamlessly configure external notifications for users within the platform, enhancing communication and user engagement.

For detailed insights, refer to the comprehensive guide on [Notifications](../concept-design/architecture/notifications).

## Managing `Notifications` in settings

Within the settings section, administrators wield control over various aspects of external notifications. Here's what you can manage:

### `Notification` instances

The flexibility of the platform shines through the ability to create, edit, and delete `Notification` instances. These instances are the building blocks that determine the content and conditions for each external notification. By managing these instances, administrators can precisely tailor the notification experience for users.

### Global configuration of notification types
  
In the ever-evolving landscape of external notifications, the platform provides a streamlined solution. Administrators can configure a global setting to determine which specific `Notification` instance should be utilized to dispatch notifications. This central configuration ensures consistent and coherent communication across the platform.
