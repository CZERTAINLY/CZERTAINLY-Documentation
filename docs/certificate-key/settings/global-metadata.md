# Global Metadata

`Global Metadata` is an abstraction layer to control and unite definition of specific metadata with same purpose. It allows the administrators to use already defined metadata marked as global and group all various content for different objects under one precise definition.

For more information, see [Global Metadata](../concept-design/architecture/attributes/global-metadata).

In the settings, you can manage the following:
- to define `Global Metadata`
- to edit existing `Global Metadata`
- to delete existing `Global Metadata`
- to promote existing `Connector` metadata as `Global Metadata`
