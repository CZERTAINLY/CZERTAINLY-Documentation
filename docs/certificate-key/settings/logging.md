# Logging

Logging settings include options for customizing how logs are handled. See [Logging](../logging/overview.md) for detailed information about logging in the platform.

The audit and event logs are disabled by default and can be configured using the logging settings.

You can see the current logging settings using [Get logging settings API](/api/core-other#tag/Settings/operation/getLoggingSettings).

To update the logging settings, use [Update logging settings API](/api/core-other#tag/Settings/operation/updateLoggingSettings).
