# Custom Attributes

`Custom Attributes` are the collection of user defined attributes that can be attached to any object in the system and are used to extend the functionality of the system and provide additional information about the object. `Custom Attributes` can be associated with resources.

For more information refer to [Custom Attributes](../concept-design/architecture/attributes/custom-attributes).

In the settings, you can manage the following:
- to create new `Custom Attributes`
- to edit existing `Custom Attributes`
- to delete existing `Custom Attributes`
- to enable or disable existing `Custom Attributes`
- to assign `Custom Attributes` to resources (object available within the system)
