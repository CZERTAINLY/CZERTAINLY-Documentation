# Externalized Authentication

Platform relies on the externalized authentication of the users.

Platform expects to get authenticated user data, meaning that the authentication was already performed by the external server.

External authentication can be performed using various mechanisms, including, but not limited to (depending on the technology):
- certificate-based authentication
- single-sign on using SAML 2.0 or OAuth 2.0
- OpenID Connect

The identity of authenticated user is forwarded to the identification service.
