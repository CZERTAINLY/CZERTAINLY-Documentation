# Custom Attributes

`Custom Attributes` are the collection of user defined attributes that can be attached to any object in the system and are used to extend the functionality of the system and provide additional information about the object. These attributes are not part of the `Connectors` and are not sent to the `Connector` when the object is created or updated.

`Custom Attributes` can be associated with resources.
