# Location

`Location` is a specific storage for certificates and cryptographic keys that can be accessed through the [`Entity`](entity).

As an example, `Location` can be:
- Software Key Store
- SSL Profile
- File System PEM
- Active Directory account

`Location` cannot exists without [`Entity`](entity) and each `Entity` can have multiple `Locations` (if supported by the implementation of `Entity Provider`).

## Characteristics

`Location` capabilities are defined by:

| Item | Description |
| - | - |
| `Entity` | `Location` can be accessed only through `Entity` that holds it |
| Multiple entries support | If the `Location` can store only one or multiple entries, typically certificates |
| Key management support | If the `Location` is capable to store and manage cryptographic keys |
| Status | Status of the `Location`, which can be <span class="badge badge--success">enabled</span> or <span class="badge badge--danger">disabled</span> |

`Location` support the following operations:
- Sync content with the inventory
- Push `Certificate` from inventory
- Remove `Certificate`

When the `Location` supports key management, additional operations can be performed:
- Issue new `Certificate`
- Renew `Certificate`
