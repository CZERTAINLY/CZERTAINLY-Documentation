# Overview

The platform is carefully designed with the following goals in mind:

- easy management of the data
- extensibility and flexibility
- technology agnostic
- easy to use and maintain
- quick installation

## Concept of the platform

It is designed as a microservice architecture with the ability to be flexible in various occasions.

It is based on the principle that the `Core` is acting as a middleman between the `Client` and the `Connector` providing the logic of all operations. The `Connector` contains the full implementation of a particular technology. It accepts the request from the `Core`, processes it, and sends back the response in a format the `Core` can understand. `Connector` is also designed to be completely independent from other paltform components.

### Architecture

The architecture of the platform is based on the following parts:

| Part                                                       | Brief description                                                                                               |
