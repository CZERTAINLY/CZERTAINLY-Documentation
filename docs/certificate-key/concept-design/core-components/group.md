# Group

`Group` represents the logical grouping of certificates and cryptographic keys based on the common characteristics.

The `Group` may be based on:

- Department that is responsible to manage certificates or keys
- Application that contains the same type of certificates and keys
- Compliance requirements
- Discovery sources
- Certificate and keys metadata

:::info
Multiple `Groups` can be created for easy management and visibility of certificates and keys.
