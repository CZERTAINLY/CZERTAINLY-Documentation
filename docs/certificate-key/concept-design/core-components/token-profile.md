# Token Profile

## What is `Token Profile`?

`Token Profile` is a representation of attributes that collectively provides a complete configuration of the cryptographic key management service which can be used by users and applications in a consistent and convenient way.

`Token Profile` provides an abstraction of the key management service configuration attributes:

- Token and its related information
- Technology-specific attributes
- Service-related configuration
- Access control configuration
- Global configuration of key usages

Additionally, `Token Profile` uses the following attributes to identify the service:

- `Token Profile` Name
- Optional description

### Characteristics

Characteristics of `Token Profile` are:

- Binds the `Token` and act as a specific key management service
- Configures specific attributes and defines the behavior of the key management service
- Provide rules for the lifecycle and operations with cryptographic keys
