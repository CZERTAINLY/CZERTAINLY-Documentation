# Overview

The platform is carefully designed with the following goals in mind:

- easy management of the data
- extensibility and flexibility
- technology agnostic
- easy to use and maintain
- quick installation

## Concept of the platform

It is designed as a microservice architecture with the ability to be flexible in various occasions.

It is based on the principle that the `Core` is acting as a middleman between the `Client` and the `Connector` providing the logic of all operations. The `Connector` contains the full implementation of a particular technology. It accepts the request from the `Core`, processes it, and sends back the response in a format the `Core` can understand. `Connector` is also designed to be completely independent from other paltform components.

### Architecture

The architecture of the platform is based on the following parts:

| Part                                                          | Brief description                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **[Database](architecture/database.md)**                      | Stores the data. SQL Database is used by default.                                                               |
| **[Core](architecture/core.md)**                              | This is the brain of the platform. It contains the full logic of request processing.                            |
| **[Interfaces](architecture/interfaces.md)**                  | Interfaces provided and used by the platform.                                                                   |
| **[Connector](architecture/connector.md)**                    | Technology implementations that interact with the `Core` to perform the designated operation on the technology. |

| **[A^2 Engine](./architecture/attributes/overview.md)**       | A^2 Engine is a component that provides the ability to define and manage attributes.                            |
| **[Notifications](./architecture/notifications.md)**          | Internal and External notifications.                                                                            |
