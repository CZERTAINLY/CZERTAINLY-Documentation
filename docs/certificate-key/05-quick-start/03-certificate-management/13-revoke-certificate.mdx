`Certificate` can be revoked from various reasons. The `RA Profile` can help us with the revocation as a single point for our certificate management service.

:::info  
Only the `Certificate` that is bound to `RA Profile` can be revoked.

## Revoke `Certificate` using the API

`Certificate` can be revoked using the `Client Operations` API. There may be some `Attributes` associated with the revocation of the `Certificate`. These `Attributes` represents requirements by some certification authority technology. We can get the list of `Attributes` for revocation of the `Certificate` using the following request:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  --cacert [ca-cert] \
  --cert [client-cert] \
  --cert-type [type] \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
    https://[domain]:[port]/api/v2/operations/authorities/e045a12a-e114-45ed-90b8-bac7e750e803/raProfiles/166b5cf52-63f2-11ec-90d6-0242ac120003/attributes/revoke
  #https://[domain]:[port]/api/v2/operations//authorities/{authorityUuid}/raProfiles/{raProfileUuid}/attributes/revoke
```

This returns the list of applicable attributes to revoke `Certificate` using the `RA Profile` service, such as:
```json
[] // empty array of Attributes
```

Knowing the attributes, we can revoke `Certificate` using the following request:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  --cacert [ca-cert] \
  --cert [client-cert] \
  --cert-type [type] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  --data '
  {
    "reason": "UNSPECIFIED",
    "attributes": []
  }' \
