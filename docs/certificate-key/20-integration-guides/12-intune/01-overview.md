# Overview

This integration guide describes how to integrate platform with [Microsoft Intune](https://learn.microsoft.com/mem/intune/fundamentals/what-is-intune) endpoint management solution.

Intune supports use of the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) to authenticate connections to your apps and corporate resources. SCEP uses the Certification Authority (CA) certificate to secure the message exchange for the Certificate Signing Request (CSR).

CZERTAINLY supports SCEP, you can use Intune SCEP certificate profiles (a type of device profile in Intune) to deploy the certificates to your devices using the SCEP protocol and the CZERTAINLY SCEP service. For more information about SCEP support in the CZERTAINLY, see the [SCEP overview](../../protocols/scep/overview).
