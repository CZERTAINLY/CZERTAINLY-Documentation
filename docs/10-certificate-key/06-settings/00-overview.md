# Configuration and Settings

Configuration of the platform and its components is done primarily through Helm chart values. The values are stored in ConfigMaps and Secrets.

For the list of parameters that can be configured for values, see the [Helm chart configurable parameteres](../installation-guide/deployment/deployment-helm/configurable-parameters).

Settings allows to configure subset of the platform setting during the runtime. The following settings are available:
- [Platform](./platform)
- [Custom Attributes](./custom-attributes)
- [Global Metadata](./global-metadata)
- [Notifications](./notifications)
