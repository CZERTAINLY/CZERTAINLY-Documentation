# CMP Profile

`CMP Profile` specifies the configurations of the CMP server behaviour. It holds the configuration listed below:

## Supported CMP variants

The platform supports the following CMP variants:
- `CMPv2` - CMP version 2 as defined by [RFC 4210](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4210)
- `CMPv2 3GPP` - CMP version 2 with 3GPP extensions as defined by [3GPP Specification](https://www.3gpp.org/specifications-technologies)

:::info
The CMP variant `CMPv3` is prepared for future use case according to the [RFC 9483 - Lightweight Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) Profile](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9483), however, not yet fully implemented.
:::

## Request and response protection methods

The platform supports the following protection methods for CMP requests and responses:
- `Shared Secret` - Shared secret for the protection of CMP message according to the [RFC 4210, section 5.1.3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4210#section-5.1.3.1)
- `Signature` - Signing of CMP message according to the [RFC 4210, section 5.1.3.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4210#section-5.1.3.3)

The following restrictions apply for the protection methods configuration:
- If the `Response Protection Method` is set to `Shared Secret`, the `Shared Secret` protection method must be configured also for the `Request Protection Method`
- If the `Request Protection Method` is set to `Signature`, the `Signature` protection method must be used also for the `Response Protection Method`

## Request signing certificate

When the `Request Protection Method` is set to `Signature`, the request must contain signing certificate in the `PKIMessage` `extraCerts` field. The first certificate in the `extraCerts` field is used for the signature verification.

## Response signing certificate requirements

The certificate with associated private key should be available in the inventory in case `Response Protection Method` is set to `Signature`. The certificate should meet the following criteria:
- The certificate should be valid
- The certificate should have associated private key managed by the platform
- The private key should be valid and active
- The private key should have the `Key Usage` set to `Sign`

## Attributes for certificate management

If a default `RA Profile` is selected then `Attributes` to issue and revoke certificates must be configured, if needed.

:::warning[Certificate operations]
Certificate management `Attributes` for `CMP Profile` are used during certificate management and cannot be changed by the CMP client.
:::

## Operations on `CMP Profile`

The following operations can be performed on the `CMP Profile`:

| Operation   | Description                                                                            |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create**  | Create a new `CMP Profile`. New `CMP Profile` is disabled by default                   |
| **Update**  | Update configuration of already existing `CMP Profile`                                 |
| **Delete**  | Delete existing `CMP Profile`                                                          |
| **Disable** | Disable existing `CMP Profile`. All request to disabled `CMP Profile` will be rejected |
| **Enable**  | Enable existing `CMP Profile`                                                          |
