# Application Logging

Application logs are generated to record the events that are affecting the platform. The application logs are used for monitoring and troubleshooting the platform.
In general, the application logs are generated by the core components of the CZERTAINLY platform and are typically sent to the standard output (stdout) or standard error (stderr) streams of containers and can be collected by the logging infrastructure.

## Structure of the application log

The application log consists of the following information:

| Part                | Short description                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Date and tme**    | Date and time when the log message was generated in the ISO 8601 format.                                                                                |
| **Level**           | The severity of the log message, see [Supported log levels](#supported-log-levels) for more information.                                                |
| **Logger type**     | The type of the logger that generated the log message. Based on the logger type, the log message can be categorized and filtered.                       |
| **Log ID**          | Unique identifier of the log message, it can be linked to process ID, thread ID, event ID, or similar identifier and correlated with other log records. |
| **Message**         | The log message                                                                                                                                         |
| **Additional Data** | Additional data that can be related to the log message in as key-value pairs.                                                                           |

## Supported log levels

There are several log levels that are supported by the CZERTAINLY platform. The log levels are used to categorize the severity of the log message. The following log levels are supported:


- **DEBUG** - Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
