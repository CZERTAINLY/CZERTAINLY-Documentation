# Configure CZERTAINLY

By default, users and roles that do not exist are rejected.

When you are integrating with AD FS, or generally with an external IdM, it is
desirable to register new users automatically, make sure that IdM assign them
some role with permissions configured within CZERTAINLY.

Automatic registration of new roles is also possible but without further
configuration of permissions, users only with those new roles will not have any
permissions within CZERTAINLY.

To enable the automatic creation of new users, define in your `values.yaml`
following section:

```yaml
authService:
  createUnknownUsers: "true"
  createUnknownRoles: "false"
```
