# Execution

Executions are the specific operations performed when a rule is evaluated as matching. These operations are processed in a specified order to ensure the correct sequence of actions. Executions are the concrete tasks that carry out the workflowâ€™s intent.

## Execution attributes

| Attribute          | Description                                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution Name** | A descriptive name for the execution.                |
| **Description**    | A brief explanation of the execution's purpose.      |
| **Execution Type** | The type of execution to be performed.               |
| **Resource**       | The object or entity to which the execution applies. |

## Execution types

Executions can be classified into various types based on the nature of the operation they perform. Each type has specific attributes and behaviors that determine how the execution is processed.
