Each role can be associated with multiple users.

The following system roles are defined:

| Role         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `superadmin` | Highest level of privilege in the platform. `superadmin` has the full permissions in the platform. Should be used as initial user and for the breaking glass in case of exceptional situation. |
| `admin`      | `admin` has the full permissions in the platform, manages users and roles, performs system configuration and administration.                                                                   |
| `acme`       | Internal role that is allowed to manage certificates and related operations that are needed as part of the [ACME](../../../protocols/acme/overview) protocol.                                  |

`superadmin` has the full permission in the platform. Therefore, it is recommended to use the `superadmin` role only if needed, for example, as a break glass functionality.
