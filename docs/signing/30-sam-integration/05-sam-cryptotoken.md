# SAM Crypto Token

Remote signing using with the SCAL2 and the CZERTAINLY Signing is possible by integrating the SAM and the signing back-end of the remote signing solution. We call it **SAMCryptoToken**. It is a special implementation of the of the CryptoToken for the CZERTAINLY Signing, which contains necessary functions and interfaces to communicate with the SAM and the userâ€™s device.

What is happening when user would like to sign the data within the context of the CZERTAINLY Signing and SCAL2? The typical signature process is as follows:

- Request to sign the data is triggered from the the client
- Signer prepares the Data To Be Signed and asks the signing back-end to confirm by the user
- User confirms the Data To Be Signed and activates the private key for the signing operation
- QSCD + SAM verifies the request and produces the signature
- Signer completes the operation and provides the result
