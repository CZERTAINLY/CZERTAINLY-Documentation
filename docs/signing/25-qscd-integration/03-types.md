# QSCD Types

Based on Article 1 of [CID (EU) 2016/650](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016D0650), two main types of QSCD exist:
- **TYPE 1 QSCD** - where the electronic signature creation data or electronic seal creation data is held in an entirely but not necessarily exclusively user-managed environment
- **TYPE 2 QSCD** - where a qualified trust service provider (QTSP) manages the electronic signature creation data or electronic seal creation data on behalf of a signatory or of a creator of a seal

:::info
Type 2 QSCD is realized by the combination of a Cryptographic Module (CM) and a dedicated Signature Activation Module (SAM). The CM provides the underlying cryptographic functionalities for secure key generation, signature generation, seal generation and key storage. The SAM ensures sole control of the signatory over the use of his electronic signature creation data and/or electronic seal creation data.

See [SAM Integration](../sam-integration/overview), for more information.
