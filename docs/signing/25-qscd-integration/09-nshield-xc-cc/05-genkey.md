# Generate Assigned Key

Assigned keys provide for more restrictive controls which are enforced with ACLs
Depending on the authorisation required, the keys can be either:
- **Token protected key**, which is a key protected by an OCS or Softcard, and a passphrase.
- **Certifier protected key**, which is a key protected by a Certifier key.

The assigned key is generated as part of the `pkcs11` application, that can be further used for signing and sealing purposes.

## Generate assigned keys

Token protected assigned keys can be created via the `generatekey` and `mkaclx` CLI utilities.

### Using the `generatekey`

To generate an assigned key using `generatekey`, use the following command:

```bash
generatekey pkcs11 assigned=yes
```

This will bring an interactive generation of the assigned key, where you need to provide at least the following:
- Key type
- Key size
- Key name
- Token (your PKCS#11 token)

This is an example output from the `generatekey` command:

```bash
generatekey pkcs11 assigned=yes
type: Key type? (DES3, DH, DHEx, DSA, HMACSHA1, HMACSHA256, HMACSHA384,
                 HMACSHA512, RSA, DES2, AES, Rijndael, ECDSA, ECDH, Ed25519,
                 X25519) [RSA] >
size: Key size? (bits, minimum 1024) [2048] >
OPTIONAL: pubexp: Public exponent for RSA key (hex)? []
>
logkeyusage: Log key usage? (yes/no) [no] >
plainname: Key name? [] > testassignedkey01
nvram: Blob in NVRAM (needs ACS)? (yes/no) [no] >

```

### Using the `mkaclx`

To generate an assigned key using `mkaclx`, use the following command:

```bash
mkaclx --assigned --no-recovery --softcard-protected=testsoftcard01 --timeout=365d --use-limit=100 testassignedkey01
```
