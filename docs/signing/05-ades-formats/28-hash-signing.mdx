# Hash Signing

Hash signing is the option for the client to pre-compute hash of the data that should be signed instead of providing the complete data. This approach may be useful to improve the overall speed of the signature processing as the server does not have to perform all steps with the signature formatting. Or it can be used when the data that should be signed are sensitive and the client does not want to share its content for the signature.

The hash signing is available for the:
- [CAdES Signer](./cades-signer/cades)
- [XAdES Signer](./xades-signer/xades)

## Detached signatures

Only detached signatures are allowed with hash signing. Detached signature is one of the packaging options where the resulting signature data is separated from the original external resources.

:::note
If the worker has configured other packaging option than `DETACHED` and hash signing is applied, the signing process it will automatically override this property and use `DETACHED` packaging.

## Activating hash signing

To activate the hash signing, you need to configure the following properties:

export const data = [
    {
        property: "CLIENTSIDEHASHING",
        description:
            (
                <>
                    Hash is expected to be provided as input for the signing process.
                </>
            ),
        default:
            (
                <>
                    <span class="badge badge--secondary">false</span>
                </>
            ),
        mandatory:
            (
                <>
                    <span class="badge badge--danger">NO</span>
                </>
            )
    },
    {
        property: "ALLOW_CLIENTSIDEHASHING_OVERRIDE",
        description:
            (
                <>
                    Allow client to specify in the <a href="#request-metadata-properties">request metadata</a> if the input data is in the form of hash and hash signing is requested.
                </>
            ),
        default:
            (
                <>
                    <span class="badge badge--secondary">false</span>
                </>
            ),
        mandatory:
            (
                <>
                    <span class="badge badge--danger">NO</span>
                </>
            )
    },
    {
        property: "ACCEPTED_HASH_DIGEST_ALGORITHMS",
        description:
            (
                <>
                    Comma-separated list of allowed digest algorithms for hash signing.
                </>
            ),
        default:
            (
                <>
                    <span class="badge badge--secondary">NONE</span>
                </>
            ),
        mandatory:
            (
                <>
                    Mandatory if:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>CLIENTSIDEHASHING</b></li>
                        <li><b>ALLOW_CLIENTSIDEHASHING_OVERRIDE</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </>
            )
    }
];

export const GenTable = ({data}) => (
    <Fragment>
        {data.map((dat, i) =>{
            return(
                <tr key={i}>
                    <td><b>{dat.property}</b></td>
                    <td>{dat.description}</td>
                    <td>{dat.default}</td>
                    <td>{dat.mandatory}</td>
                </tr>)
        })}
    </Fragment>
);

    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
    <th>Mandatory</th>
    <tbody>
    <GenTable data={data}/>
    </tbody>
</table>

:::warning
When you configure both `CLIENTSIDEHASHING=true` and `ALLOW_CLIENTSIDEHASHING_OVERRIDE=true`, the `CLIENTSIDEHASHING` takes precedence and all requests will be considered as requests for hash signing. If you want to keep the decision on the client, use only `ALLOW_CLIENTSIDEHASHING_OVERRIDE=true`.

## Hash signing data format

When the hash signing is activated, worker is expected to receive **Base64-encoded data of the hash** pre-computed by the client as input for the signing request.

## Request metadata properties

The following metadata should be provided by the client in the signing request when hash signing is activated:

export const requestdata = [
    {
        property: "CLIENTSIDE_HASHDIGESTALGORITHM",
        description:
            (
                <>
                    Specifies the digest algorithm used to digest the data provided for the hash signing.
                </>
            ),
        mandatory:
            (
                <>
                    <span class="badge badge--success">YES</span>
                </>
            )
    },
    {
        property: "USING_CLIENTSUPPLIED_HASH",
        description:
            (
                <>
                    Specifies if the data provided are already digested by the client or not.
                </>
            ),
        mandatory:
