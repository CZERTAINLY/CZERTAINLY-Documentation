# Overview

Although the ILM platform is technology independent, each technology has its own specifics that the users should be able to use properly.

The platform uses `Attribute` to control such specific behaviour of different technologies, like certification authorities, credential providers, discovery of certificates, etc. So called `Attributes` are used in almost every `Connector` and developer must understand them in order to implement custom behaviour or extend the functionality of the platform.

:::info
For more information about the concept behind the `Connector`, `Attributes`, `Callbacks`, etc, see the [platform overview](../../certificate-key/concept-design/overview.md).

Now let's take a look on what exactly is an `Attribute` and how it can be used.

## It is all about the `Attributes`

The concept works on the principle of exchanging and validation of `Attributes` between the `Client`, `Connector` and the platform.
Implementation of some specific `Connector` must be able to define and properly handle its specific `Attributes`. The definition is then exchanged with the `Client` and the platform validates it consistency and mediate the flow and logic between them:

```plantuml
    @startuml
        Client ->> Platform: list available Attributes
        Platform ->> Platform: check and validate request
        Platform ->> Connector: get Attributes for the Client
        Connector <<->> Technology: get technology data
        Connector ->> Platform: Attributes definition
        Platform ->> Platform: validate Attributes definition
        Platform ->> Client: Attributes definition
        Client ->> Platform: set Attributes
        Platform ->> Platform: validate and merge Attributes
        Platform ->> Connector: request with the content of Attributes
        Connector <<->> Technology: use Attributes and process request
    @enduml
```

Because the communication is controlled by the platform, it ensures the consistency and security of the `Attributes` that are exchanged between the `Client` and the `Connector`, and eventually applied in the target technology.

## `BaseAttribute`

The `BaseAttribute` is the base class for all `Attributes`. It contains the basic properties that are common for all `Attributes` and uses the generic type `T` to define the `content`. Attributes are available in two versions — **V2** and **V3**. The basic functionality of both versions is the same. The key differences in V3 are:

- Required `schemaVersion` field (value `"v3"`)
- Each content item includes an explicit `contentType` field
- New `RESOURCE OBJECT` content type for referencing platform resources (replaces V2-only `SECRET` and `CREDENTIAL` content types)

:::warning[V2 is deprecated]
**V2 attributes are deprecated.** All new connector implementations should use **V3** attribute classes. V2 is maintained for backward compatibility with existing connectors but will not receive new features. Existing connectors are encouraged to migrate to V3.

You can find specification of the `BaseAttribute` in the [Interfaces repository](https://github.com/OmniTrustILM/interfaces).

Table below describes the properties of the `BaseAttribute`:

| Property      | Type                                                | Short description                                                                                                                                   | Required                                      |

| `uuid`        | `string`                                            | UUID of the defined `Attribute`. The combination of the `Connector` UUID and the `Attribute` UUID must be unique                                    | <span class="badge badge--success">Yes</span> |
| `name`        | `string`                                            | Name of the `Attribute`                                                                                                                             | <span class="badge badge--success">Yes</span> |
| `description` | `string`                                            | Description of the `Attribute` for better understanding of the `Attribute` purpose. This should contain descriptive explanation of the `Attribute`. | <span class="badge badge--danger">No</span>   |
| `type`        | [`AttributeType`](./attributes.mdx#attribute-types) | Type of the `Attribute`                                                                                                                             | <span class="badge badge--success">Yes</span> |

| `version`     | `integer`                                           | Version of the `Attribute`. Supported versions are `2` and `3`, where `2` is currently the default version.                                         | <span class="badge badge--success">Yes</span> |
| `schemaVersion` | [`AttributeVersion`](https://github.com/OmniTrustILM/interfaces/blob/main/src/main/java/com/otilm/api/model/common/attribute/common/AttributeVersion.java) | Schema version of the `Attribute`. **Required for V3** (value `"v3"`), not applicable to V2. | <span class="badge badge--success">Yes (V3)</span> |

## `Attribute` building blocks:

Each implementation of `Attribute` type consists of the following building blocks:

- `AttributeProperties` - properties defines the behaviour of the `Attribute`
- `AttributeContent` - specific content of the `Attribute` that is defined based on the `content` type
- `AttributeConstraint` - constraint that defines the validation of the `Attribute` content
- `AttributeCallback` - callback that is used to get the `Attribute` content when it depends on other factors

```plantuml
@startuml
package Attribute {
    object AttributeProperties
    object AttributeContent
    object AttributeConstraint
    object AttributeCallback
}
@enduml
```

The building blocks for each particular `Attribute` type are described in [Attributes](./attributes.mdx) section.

## Building blocks description and examples

The following section describes in detail each building block of the `Attribute` and provides examples of the `Attributes`.
