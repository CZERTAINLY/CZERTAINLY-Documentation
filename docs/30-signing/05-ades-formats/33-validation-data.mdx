# Validation Data

You can configure AdES Signers to return the validation data for the signature. In this case, the following validation data is collected for each signature and certificate in the signature:
- all certificates in the certificate chain that is needed to validate the signature and timestamps
- all CRLs that are needed to validate the signatures and timestamps
- all OCSP responses that are needed to validate the signatures and timestamps

To enable the validation data, you can set the following properties in Signer:

export const data = [
    {
        property: "WRAP_WITH_VALIDATION_INFO",
        description:
            (
                <>
                    Enable the collection of validation data for the signature.
                </>

:::tip[External CMS Signer with Validation Data]
If you are using the [External CMS Signer](./pades-signer/external-cms), you can get the validation data for the signature and embed it into the resulting PDF document without having to implement the validation data collection yourself, achieving the same result as with the PAdES Signer on Baseline signatures levels B-LT and B-LTA.
:::

## Structure of the Validation Data

When enabled, the signature response is returned as a JSON object containing the `validationData` field:

```json
"signatureData": "MIIdSQYJ...",
"validationData": {
    "crl": [],
    "ocsp": [],
    "certificates": []
}
```

Where:
- **`crl`** is an array of Base64-encoded CRLs
- **`ocsp`** is an array of Base64-encoded OCSP responses
- **`certificates`** is an array of Base64-encoded certificates

### Batch signing

When using batch signatures, the `signatureData` has a form of JSON object representing the batch signature response as defined in [Batch Signing](./batch-signing). The `validationData` is common to all signatures as the signatures were created by the same key.
