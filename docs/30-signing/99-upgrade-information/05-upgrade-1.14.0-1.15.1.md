In release version `1.15.0` the following changes were made as part of the integration efforts with the CZERTAINLY platform:

## TimeMonitor using built-in SNTP in containerized deployments

The legacy NTP implementation using local NTP commands was replaced with the built-in SNTP implementation in the dockerized deployments.

No changes to the configuration of Time Monitor are needed.
