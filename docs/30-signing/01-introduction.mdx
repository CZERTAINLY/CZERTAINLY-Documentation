The CZERTAINLY Signing is a set of modules and implementations that enables eIDAS compliant remote signing on advanced or qualified assurance level.
It is a everything you need package, which is further developed in time to support varios technologies and use cases.

The SignServer comes with a number of out-of-the-box available modules and functionality. CZERTAINLY Signing builds on top of the SignServer in order to provide additional functionality.

The CZERTAINLY Signing adds the following parts:

                    Using the SAML 2.0 Authorizer, you can configure the behaviour of the request authorization based on the SAML signed assertions. Request are authorized only when the assertion contains trusted and validated data.
