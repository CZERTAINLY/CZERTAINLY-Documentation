# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Documentation site for ILM (Identity Lifecycle Management) — an open-source trust lifecycle management platform. Built with **Docusaurus 3.7** and deployed to GitHub Pages at https://docs.otilm.com.

## Commands

```bash
yarn install                # Install dependencies
yarn start                  # Dev server at http://localhost:3000
yarn build                  # Production build to ./build (NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=4096")
yarn serve                  # Serve production build locally
yarn clear                  # Clear Docusaurus cache
yarn render-diagrams        # Render all PlantUML diagrams to static/img/plantuml/ (also runs automatically on start/build)
yarn fetch-api-specs        # Download the OpenAPI documents (also runs automatically on start/build)
yarn copy-scalar-runtime    # Vendor the Scalar bundle (also runs automatically on start/build)
yarn verify-api-build       # Check ./build has every API page, document and runtime, and that links resolve
yarn update-api-anchors     # Rewrite diagram operation links to the fragments Scalar serves
yarn test                   # Run unit tests (node --test)
yarn coverage               # Unit tests with coverage thresholds enforced
```

> **Prerequisite:** `yarn start` and `yarn build` render all PlantUML diagrams at build time through a pinned
> `plantuml-server` Docker image, so a running **Docker daemon is required**. `yarn build` renders up-front via the
> `prebuild` hook; `yarn start` renders via the `plantumlRenderPlugin` Docusaurus lifecycle plugin, which also
> re-renders diagrams live as docs change during dev. To render against an already-running server instead, set
> `PLANTUML_SERVER_URL` (e.g. `PLANTUML_SERVER_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 yarn build`).

The build downloads 52 OpenAPI documents from `https://api.otilm.com/` into `static/api-specs/`, so it
is network-dependent. They are **not** rendered at build time — Scalar renders them in the browser.

**Build memory is no longer dominated by the API reference.** Redocusaurus used to server-render every
operation of every document during static generation, costing ~175 MB of peak heap per document: with
48 documents the build peaked at ~9.5 GB, against a ~1.1 GB baseline with no documents at all. Since
the switch to Scalar the cost is close to that baseline — with all 52 it peaks at ~3.3 GB and the
bundling and generation phases take under 30 s, and it succeeds with a heap limit as low as 3072 MB.
Adding an API is now an ordinary catalog change, not a build-infrastructure decision.

A *cold* wall-clock build is much longer than that, because `prebuild` renders every PlantUML diagram
through Docker; only diagrams whose source changed are re-rendered, so a warm build skips it.

The heap limit is set in two places that must stay in sync: the `NODE_OPTIONS` above and
`.github/workflows/documentation.yml`. It is 4096 MB — headroom over the 3072 MB that was measured to
work. If a release makes the build fail with a `SIGABRT` heap-limit crash (which reads like CI
infrastructure flakiness), raise both together after confirming with one cold build:
`yarn clear && NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=<limit> yarn build`.

### Remote docs (five synced sets)

These directories are **not authored here**. `docusaurus-plugin-remote-content` downloads them from their source repositories at a pinned ref, so local edits are overwritten on the next download — fix errors upstream.

| Target directory | Source repository and path | Pin | Download command |
|---|---|---|---|
| `docs/certificate-key/installation-guide/deployment/deployment-helm/` | `OmniTrustILM/helm-charts` `charts/ilm/docs/` | `chartVersion` | `yarn docusaurus download-remote-helm-docs` |
| `docs/certificate-key/installation-guide/deployment/deployment-operator/` | `OmniTrustILM/operator` `docs/site/` (the five journey pages) | `operatorDocsRef` | `yarn docusaurus download-remote-operator-docs` |
| `docs/certificate-key/installation-guide/deployment/deployment-operator/custom-resources/` | `OmniTrustILM/operator` `docs/site/custom-resources/` (the four CR guides) | `operatorDocsRef` | `yarn docusaurus download-remote-operator-cr-docs` |
| `docs/certificate-key/cli/` | `OmniTrustILM/cli` `docs/site/` | `cliDocsRef` | `yarn docusaurus download-remote-cli-docs` |
| `docs/contributors/development-environment.md` | `OmniTrustILM/development-environment` `docs/site/` | `devenvDocsRef` | `yarn docusaurus download-remote-devenv-docs` |

The two operator entries share `operatorDocsRef` and are always re-pinned together. The `_category_.json` in each target directory **is** authored here — it is not in any `documents` array, so a download never touches it.

The operator, cli and devenv pages follow two rules, enforced upstream: every page carries `sidebar_position` front matter, and links are relative within the synced set (same-directory, or one level between `docs/site/` and `docs/site/custom-resources/` in the operator set) — everything else is an absolute URL. (The helm set predates both rules and carries no front matter.) `markdown.hooks.onBrokenMarkdownLinks` is `'throw'`, so a link violation fails `yarn build` rather than printing a warning nobody reads.

> **The helm set is pinned behind its fix.** `charts/ilm/docs/overview.md` carried a link out of its own directory (`../../messaging-rabbitmq`), which was hand-patched here after a sync — the exact failure mode the `'throw'` flip exists to prevent. The upstream fix is merged on `helm-charts` `main` but is **not** in the `2.19.0` tag that `chartVersion` pins, so `download-remote-helm-docs` must not be re-run until `chartVersion` advances. If it is, the build now fails loudly instead of regressing silently.

> **The three new pins are merge commits, not tags.** `operatorDocsRef`, `cliDocsRef` and `devenvDocsRef` name the merge commits that first published each synced set, because none of the three repositories has cut a release containing its docs yet. The operator and cli release runbooks move them to `v` + `operatorVersion` / `v` + `cliVersion` at the next release. `cli/commands.md` is generated upstream by `make docs` — never edit it here.

## Architecture

### Documentation Structure

All docs live in `/docs` and are organized into two major domains:

- **`certificate-key/`** — PKI: certificate management, key management, connectors, protocols (ACME, CMP, SCEP), deployment, integrations (ADCS, EJBCA, HashiCorp Vault, Keycloak, Intune)
- **`signing/`** — Digital signatures: AdES formats (PAdES, CAdES, XAdES, JAdES, ASiC), validation, HSM integration (nShield, Utimaco, Trident), CSC component
- **`contributors/`** — Developer/contributor guides
- **`community/`** — Community resources

Sidebar is auto-generated from the filesystem (`sidebars.js` uses `autogenerated`). Page ordering is controlled by `sidebar_position` in MDX front matter.

### Custom Remark Plugins (`src/plugins/`)

- **`remarkFindReplacePlugin.mjs`** — Replaces `%API_BASE_URL%` with `https://docs.otilm.com/api/` in all doc content. Use `%API_BASE_URL%` when linking to API docs within markdown.
- **`remarkSimplePlantumlPlugin.mjs`** — Rewrites fenced `plantuml` code blocks into `<img>` tags pointing at build-time-rendered static SVGs in `static/img/plantuml/<hash>.svg`. The SVGs are produced by `scripts/render-diagrams.mjs`.

### API Documentation

52 OpenAPI documents are published at `/api/<id>` and rendered by **Scalar**. Everything is driven from
one catalog, `src/data/apiCatalog.mjs`, which lists each API as an `[id, label]` row inside a group.
That single list generates the routes **and** the navbar menus — there is no second place to update.

**To add an API:** add a row to the right group. The document URL defaults to
`https://api.otilm.com/<apiVersion>/doc-openapi-<id>.yaml` and the route to `/api/<id>`. Add a third
element only when the document is named differently (`core-key` is the one such case). A group with a
single entry renders as a plain navbar link, a group with several as a dropdown.

Versions and the remote-content pins live in `src/data/versions.mjs`:
- `apiVersion` — core, connector, messaging and protocol documents
- `chartVersion` — Helm chart (used by `docusaurus-plugin-remote-content`)
- `cscVersion` — CSC component, versioned independently
- `operatorVersion`, `cliVersion` — substituted into docs as `%OPERATOR_VERSION%` / `%CLI_VERSION%`
- `operatorDocsRef`, `cliDocsRef`, `devenvDocsRef` — immutable refs for the synced doc sets

**How it fits together.** `src/plugins/scalarApiPlugin.mjs` runs in `loadContent`, which Docusaurus
completes before it configures the bundler that copies `static/` — so the plugin can materialize
assets there. It downloads every document to `static/api-specs/<version>/<id>.yaml` and vendors the
Scalar bundle to `static/scalar/standalone-<version>.js`. Both directories are generated and
gitignored. Documents are validated on download (a `200` carrying an HTML error page or truncated
YAML fails the build), and each page's `<title>` and description come from the document's `info`
block, so they match what Redoc produced.

Scalar renders **in the browser**. Nothing parses an OpenAPI document during static generation, which
is what keeps the build cheap — but it also means a mistake surfaces as a blank page at runtime
rather than a build error. `yarn verify-api-build` is the guard: it checks that every one of the 52
pages, every document and the runtime actually landed in `build/`. Note that `onBrokenLinks` cannot
do this job — `%API_BASE_URL%` expands to an absolute URL, which Docusaurus treats as external.

### Linking to the API reference

Two syntaxes are in use, and both must follow the same three rules:

```
[Update OAuth2 provider settings](/api/core-other#tag/settings/PUT/v1/settings/authentication/oauth2Providers/{providerName})

skinparam topurl /api/
    Client -> Core [[core-authority#tag/authority-management/POST/v1/authorities]]: Add Authority
```

1. **No trailing slash after the id.** The site publishes `/api/core-other`; `/api/core-other/` is a
   404. This applies to plain page links too — `](/api/core-auth/)` is broken, `](/api/core-auth)`
   is not.
2. **Diagrams use `skinparam topurl /api/`**, never an absolute URL and never `%API_BASE_URL%`. The
   base has to be site-relative or the link drags a reader on localhost over to production; and the
   placeholder is never expanded in a diagram, because `render-diagrams.mjs` reads raw markdown and
   the remark replacement only touches page content.
3. **Fragments are Scalar's**, `tag/<tag-slug>/<METHOD>/<path>`, not Redoc's
   `operation/<operationId>`. The tag slug lowercases, hyphenates spaces and *drops* punctuation
   (`Statistics/Dashboard` becomes `statisticsdashboard`). A whole tag section is just `tag/<slug>`.

Don't hand-write a fragment. Write the link against an operationId in either syntax and run
`yarn update-api-anchors`; it derives the right fragment from the downloaded document, fixes the
trailing slash, and is idempotent.

`yarn verify-api-build` enforces all three: it fails on a trailing slash, on a non-relative diagram
base, on an id the catalog does not publish, and on a fragment the document does not offer. So an
API release that renames or moves an operation breaks the build instead of leaving a dead link.
Docusaurus checks fragments on markdown links itself, but it cannot see inside a rendered diagram,
and it only knows the fragments a page declares — which is why both checks exist.

**Why the API pages declare their fragments.** Docusaurus' broken-anchor check reads the fragments
present in a page's *server-rendered* HTML. Scalar creates them in the browser, so an API page
appears to have none and every link into an operation would be reported broken. The route component
therefore calls `useBrokenLinks().collectAnchor()` for each fragment its document actually offers,
supplied per route by `scalarApiPlugin` from the downloaded document. Only real fragments are
declared, so a link to an operation that does not exist is still reported.

The reference is deliberately read-only, matching Redoc: Scalar's API client, "Test Request", the
Developer Tools bar, the AI agent and telemetry are all disabled in `src/lib/scalarConfig.mjs`.
`src/css/scalar.css` maps Infima's theme onto Scalar's variables. One Infima quirk to know: in light
mode `--ifm-background-color` is `transparent`, not white, so a `var(..., #fff)` fallback never fires
and opaque surfaces must be set explicitly.

### Custom React Components (`src/components/`)

TSX components used on the homepage and in docs: `HomepageFeatures`, `PlatformModules`, `WhatIsILM`, `CardLink`, `Divider`.

### Key Configuration

- `docusaurus.config.js` — Main config: plugins, presets, navbar, Algolia search, theme
- `src/data/apiCatalog.mjs` — The published APIs; generates both the `/api/*` routes and the navbar menus
- `src/data/versions.mjs` — component versions and the remote-content sync pins
- `sidebars.js` — Auto-generated sidebar config
- Syntax highlighting includes: PowerShell, Java, HCL, Scala, Bash (via Prism)
- `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` — Build fails on broken internal links

## Writing Documentation

- Docs use **MDX** (JSX in Markdown) — `.md` and `.mdx` extensions both work
- Use `%API_BASE_URL%` placeholder to reference API documentation URLs
- PlantUML diagrams: use fenced code blocks with language `plantuml`
- The `documentation` branch is the main/default branch for this repo
- Prose uses **US English** (`behavior`, `finalize`, `synchronized`)

### Naming the product

Write **"the platform"**, not the brand name, wherever a functional term works — "the platform validates the request", not "ILM validates the request". A page may name the product once where it genuinely introduces it (a section intro, a GitHub link label); everywhere else the brand name is churn waiting for the next rename. Never coin compound names like "ILM Core" — the component is `Core`. The same applies inside diagrams: participants are `Core`, `Platform`, `Connector`.

### Diagrams

Rendered PlantUML SVGs scale down to the content column (`img[src^="/img/plantuml/"]` in `src/css/custom.css`), so a wide diagram no longer overflows — but it renders small. Keep a diagram under roughly 1000px natural width: wrap long message labels with `\n`, stack multi-word participant names, and split a diagram that outgrows that rather than letting it shrink. To check a diagram's rendered width, run `yarn render-diagrams` and read the `width:` value from its SVG in `static/img/plantuml/`.

Within a diagram, keep message labels consistent with each other and with the page's prose: sentence case for actions (`Validate certificate`, not `validate certificate`), and the same component names the surrounding text uses.

### Integration Guides

Each integration lives in its own directory under `docs/certificate-key/integration-guides/<technology>/`:

- A `_category_.json` sets the sidebar `label`, an explicit `position` (integrations are ordered by product, not alphabetically), and a `link` of type `doc` pointing at the entry page
- Multi-page guides use `overview.md` as that entry page, with a step table linking to one page per task; single-page guides use `integration-guide.md`
- Page order inside the directory comes from `sidebar_position` in the front matter, with the overview at position 1
- Guides describe what to configure in the third-party product and in the platform. Deploying the connector itself belongs in the installation guide, not here
- Prefer naming entities and their attributes over navigation paths — product menus change more often than the concepts do

## CI/CD

GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/documentation.yml`):
- **On PR to `documentation`**: runs `yarn install --frozen-lockfile && yarn build` as a check
- **On push to `documentation`**: builds and deploys to GitHub Pages
